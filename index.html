    <p class="content">
      My name is Joseph Coburn. 
      I love exploring and seeing new things. 
      I love traveling. That's when I'm really in my element. 
      I get so much gratitude for life by surrounding myself with 
      different people, cultures, traditions, foods, and landscapes. 
      I also love skateboarding, playing guitar, and being active.
    </p>

    <h1 class="header">Background</h1>

      <p class="content">
        I moved to California from my hometown in Pennsylvania
        a few years after finishing high school. I came here 
        with my girlfriend, Heather. We never imagined we'd be 
        living in LA, but now we can say we've done it! She's like me.
        We love spending time in nature together, traveling, 
        eating delicious food, watching movies, and spending time 
        with our two beautiful cats/children, Kiwi and Lyla. Wherever
        life takes us, we know we'll always have eachother.
      </p>
